## <a name="nativeAD">Native Ad</a>

There are two available modes to choose from for Native Ad integration: `Template` and `RAW`, select a suitable mode accordingly, Template provides a pre-set view containing main ad asset and attached touch event detection, where RAW offers assets in their original states for you to process and requires to call `registerViewForInteraction` method to inform SDK to add touch event detection.

Native Ad is set to be using Template mode by default, or call `apNativeInstance.setPattern(patternEnum)` method to change.

1. **Instantiation**
	
	To create an instance of Native Ad
	
	```
	APNative apNative = new APNative(activity, "slotID", listener);
	```
	
	Parameters	|	Description

	```
	
	Parameters	|	Description
	---	|	---
	viewContainer	|	The view which will contain this Native ad
	viewWidth	| Use APNative.MATCH_PARENT or specific width in px to adjust ad view size
	
	**Note**: This method does NOT add ad view to contain view automatically
	
	**Note**: Please make sure that this view is added to container view before ad is about to 	show
	
6. **Report impression**

	Once ad is displayed to users, please call this method to report ad impression.
	```
	apNative.show();
	```
	
7. **Delegate methods of Native Ad**

	Please add the following calls to Activity callbacks respectively
	* `onPause`：`apNative.onPause();`
	* `onResume`：`apNative.onResume();`
	* `onDestroy`：`apNative.onDestroy();`
	
8. **Destroy Native**

	Once a Native ad is no longer needed, use this method to recycle its assets immediately.

	```
	apNative.destroy();
	```

## <a name="splashAD">Splash Ad</a>

## <a name="permissions">Permissions</a>

* SDK will request for these following permissions
	* `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`
	* `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
	* `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
* SDK initialization (`APSDK.init(context,appID,channelID)`) triggers requesting for permissions as part of init process, call this `APCore.setAutoRequestPermission(false)` to stop SDK doing so automatically, please make sure that your code will request for the same permissions at later stage, otherwise SDK may not function properly


## <a name="others">etc</a>

* If you wishes to inform users before download starts under cellular network, use this method to enable this feature `APAD.setIsMobileNetworkDirectlyDownload(boolean)`, default is set to `true`
* supported cpu architecture: `armeabi-v7a`
